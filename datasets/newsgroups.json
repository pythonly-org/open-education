    "text": "\n   {Description of \"External Tank\" option for SSF redesign deleted}\n\n\nYo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\noptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\nthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\n\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\ntoday's Times).\n\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\noption are:\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's\n     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n     for the Air Force.\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n     source for 30 day missions.\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n     add another 20 kW of power\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n     Vehicle).\n\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\nhave all come to know and love :)\n\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\n\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\n     it visits.\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n     assembly in 24 flights.\n\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\nchanges.",

    "text": "Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie \"The Last\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \"Eiffel\nII\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)",

My\nguess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to\nbuild large, inflatable space structures.\n\n\nIf this is true, I think it's a great idea.\n\nLearning how to build to build structures in space in an essential\nstep towards space development, and given that Freedom appears to be\nshrinking towards the vanishing point, I question whether NASA's space\nstation is going to provide much, if any, knowledge in this area.\n(Especially if a design such as Faget's wingless orbiter is chosen...)\nIf such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates\ncreative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so\nmuch the better.\n\n\nAnd does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\nnews blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \"wild\nidea\" stage or does it have real funding?\n\n\nNot yet.  Though, if this project goes through, I suppose The Return\nof Jeremy Rifkin is inevitable...\n--\n_______________________________________________________________________________",

    "text": "The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly\nhad with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\n\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\n\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\nwe brought up.\n\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\n\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\nin those sectors.\n\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\n\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\n\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\n\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\nhappen immediatly there.\n\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\nreally did know the answers.\n\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\n\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.",

    "text": "Archive-name: space/astronaut\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $\n\nHOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT\n\n    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA\n    announcement.\n\n    Q. How do I become an astronaut?\n\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\n    specialist\".\n\n    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\n\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\n\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\t(DO NOT get a\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\n    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.\n\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\n    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\n    Keep your nose clean.\n\n    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\n\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\n\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\n    to demonstrate motivation.\n\n    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.\n\n\n\n\n    NASA\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\n    Houston, Texas\n\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\n    ==================================================================\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ---------------------------\n\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\n\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\n    considered.\n\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\n    program.\n\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\n    ---------------------------------\n\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\n    flight crew.\n\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\n    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\n    government agencies and private industries.\n\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\n    astronauts.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut\n\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle.

When NASA\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\n\n    Active Duty Military\n\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\n\n    Selection\n    ---------\n\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\n\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\n    their establishment.\n\n    General Program Requirements\n\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\n    their candidate period.\n\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\n    specified tour of duty.\n\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\n\n    Pay and Benefits\n    ----------------\n\n    Civilians\n\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\n    and experience.\n\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\n\n    Military\n\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\n    other similar military matters.\n",

Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\n\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\nthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human\nbody produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar\nflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine. \nDoes this ring a bell to anyone?",

    "text": "\nI was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\ngenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at\nthe meeting. Here goes : \n\n\t\t\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\n\t\t\t-------------------------\n\n1. Introduction\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\n\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\n\n2.Design\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\n\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n3.Missions\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\nrate.\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\nbase, BTW]\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\nnucleus.

For\nexample, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \"safe\"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n\"turned off\" rather than just \"safed\".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  \n\nI've heard the argument that an active but \"uncontrolled\"\nspacecraft causes \"radio noise.\"  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed \"safe\" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a \"pause\" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n\"drift\" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n",

I hadn't bought a new\ncar since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by\nmost salespeople I met.\n\nSaturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where\nI bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales\nsupport, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what\nI wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the\ndealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on\nwhat he's seen and heard from his customers. \n\nSaturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles, \nfully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or\nso, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more\nlike $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any\nwarranty work, without counting against the refund.",

I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since \nthe initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a \nservice bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you \nmay be able to get your dealer to fix it.\n\n\nHaven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the\nmailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.\n\n\nDefinitely!\n\n\nNo problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious \nplaces where they screwed up.\n\n\nHmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by\nyour dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \"credit card\" key that \ncame in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key\ndoesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))\n\n\nThe latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up\nall the space where you'd expect to find the horn.\n\nSpeaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one\nof those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind.\nThe previous Probes had Japanese horns.\n\n\nYeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.\n\n\nI agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The\ninterior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically\nsound.\n\n...\n\nYes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it,\nbut if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly\nsuggest looking into the MX-6.\n\n\nThe problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of \nhead room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints,\nso long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to \ngive them a place to put their feet.\n\n\nThe power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-)\nI really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker\nfor open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!\n\n\nI haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes\n('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which\nFord will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like\nthis concerning the '93 Probes.\n\nI haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot\nthat was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even\ngave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my\ncar.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering\nthat I was expecting the worst from them!\n\nFrom what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with \nthe Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but \nI think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's\nalmost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-chuck-",

At the time of the hearing, average \nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's \nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\n\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.

The main \nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \nleast four attempts.\n\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.",

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\n\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\n  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper\n  from their vehicle :) .\n\nThe Particulars:\n\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\n* A valid drivers license is required\n* Suggested equipment:\n      CB Radio\n      Compass\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\n      Clip Board and Pencil\n* No alcohol during rally\n* For more information contact\n   Gary (815)727-3415\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\n   Brian (708)979-6083\n\n\n                                            __\n              Instant                      /\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\n------|---------------------------------------------\n Exit |              |             |         ^\n 257  |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\n      |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |       Rt80                 |         v",

Image analysis software - Image processing and display\n==========================================================\n\nPC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)\n======================\n\nIMDISP\n------\n  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\n  [PC and Macs]\n\nLabVIEW 2\n---------\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been\n  developed by Spyglass.\n\n  Spyglass, Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign, IL  61820 (217) 355-6000\n  fax: 217 355 8925\n\nNIH IMAGE\n---------\n  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)\n  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.\n  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,\n  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting\n  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of\n  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined\n  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw\n  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also\n  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,\n  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\n\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\n\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\n---------------------------\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the \"auto selection tool\"\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\n  hues, color range and mask.\n\nImageStudio: Don't know...\n\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\n\nDapple Systems\n--------------\n  \"High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.\"\n\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283\n\nDigital Darkroom\n----------------\n  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and\n  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to\n  select part of an image simply by \"painting\" it. A new polyline\n  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide\n  selections.  A brush lets the operator \"paint\" with a selected portion\n  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.\n  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale\n  images only.

The tool has over 80 mathematical filter\n  variations: \"Laplacian, medium noise filter\", etc.  Files can be saved\n  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).\n\n  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109\n\nImage Analyst\n-------------\n  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative\n  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry's CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Documentation (PostScript mostly)\n  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),\n  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - \"AIPS++\" - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\n  Australia to name a few. \n\nLABOimage\n---------\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently\n  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\n\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\no  image & constant: + - / *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

Features\n===========\n\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\n\n\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\n\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\n\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\n\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\n\n - color-space selection\n\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\n\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\n\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\n\n...\n\n4. Technical information\n========================\n\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\nareas.\n\n...\n",

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\nThat were not done and now we have\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\n -the program has human interface errors.\n\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\n\n[ ..deleted.. ]\n\n==clip==\n\nSome new items follows.\n\n==clip==\n\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\noption than with default option we have.\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\n\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\n\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\n\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\ncan say nothing about it.)\n\n==clip==\n\n==clip==\n\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\n\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\n\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\n\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\nand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be\nupdated when the setting are not ready yet.\nI suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.",

In other words, the distance between the ellipse\nand its offset is same everywhere.\n\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\npositions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\n\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\n\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem.

Author:\n\tStephen Coy (coy@ssc-vax.boeing.com).  The 386/387 (no source) version\n\tis available to registered users (US$50) direct from the author.\nRAY4 - Steve Hollasch's 4-dimensional ray tracer - renders hyperspheres,\n\thypertetrahedra, hyperplanes, and hyperparallelepipeds (there's\n\ta separate real-time wireframe viewer written in GL called WIRE4 ) .\nMTV,QRT,DBW - yet more ray tracers, some with interesting features.\n\nDistributed/Parallel Raytracers:\n--------------------------------\n\nXDART - A distributed ray-tracer that runs under X11. There are server binaries\n\twhich work only on DECstations, SPARCs, HP Snakes (7x0 series) and NeXT.\n\tThe clients are distributed as binaries and C source.\nInetray - A network version of Rayshade 4.0.  Needs Sun RPC 4.0 or newer.\n\tContact Andreas Thurnherr (ant@ips.id.ethz.ch)\nprt, VM_pRAY - parallel ray tracers.\n\nVolume renderers:\n-----------------\n\nVREND - Cornell's Volume Renderer, from Kartch/Devine/Caffey/Warren (FORTRAN).\n\nRadiosity (and diffuse lighting) renderers:\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRadiance - a ray tracer w/radiosity effects, by Greg Ward.  Excellent shading\n\tmodels and physically based lighting simulation.  Unix/X based, though\n\thas been ported to the Amiga and the PC (386).\nINDIA - An Indian radiosity package based on Radiance.\nSGI_RAD - An interactive radiosity package that runs on SGI machines with a\n\tSpaceball. It includes a house database.\n\tAuthor: Guy Moreillon <moreillo@ligsg1.epfl.ch>\nRAD - a simple public-domain radiosity package in C.

These objects range from human figures to airplanes,\n  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely\n  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.\n\n  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file\n  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the\n  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially\n  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various\n  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,\n  Rayshade 4.0, or vort.

Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360\n  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for\n  every half degree longitude and latitude.\n \n  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine\n  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).\n  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and\n  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as\n  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask\n  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.\n  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.\n  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to\n  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.\n\nNCAR data\n---------\n  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of\n  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at\n  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.\n  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending\n  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,\n  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).

Teapot ?\n-----------\n\n\"Displays on Display\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole\nstory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has\nthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe\nmodel of the teapot.\n\nIEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \"Jim Blinn's Corner\" describes\nan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for\nexample are used.\n\nThe OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get\nthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at\na specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).\nThe SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a\ntessellation at any specified resolution.\n\nb. Space Shuttle ?\n------------------\n\nTolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle\ndatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):\n\nmodel1:\nA modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)\n\n406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)\n389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).\nPayload doors non-existent.\nUnits: unknown.\n\nSimon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy.

You can find it in\n\ngondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo\nhanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data\n\nmodel3:\nThe triangles' model.\n\nThis model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.\n\nGreg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did\nnot mention any restriction on the model's distribution.\n\nmodel4:\nThe NASA model.\n\nThe file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,\ndefining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:\n\n<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>\n\nFrom then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions\n\n3473 vertices.\n2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,\n 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,\n 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).\nPayload doors closed.\nUnits: inches.\n\nJon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model\nProprietary info: unknown\n\nmodel5:\nThe old shuttle model.\n\nThe file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.\n\n104 vertices.\n452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).\nPayload doors open.\nUnits: meters.\n\nWe have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for\nsome years now.

Image annotation software\n=============================\n\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\n  rasterfile.\n\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not\n  sure exactly what they are.\n  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\n\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\n  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\n\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\n\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\n\nf.

This was\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\n  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a\n  freebie if you want it\"\n\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\n  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\n  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical\n  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\n\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\n===================================================\n\nGRASS\n-----\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\n  capabilities.\n\n  Feature Descriptions\n\n  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\n\n  Availability\n\n  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\n\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\n  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\n\n  Support\n\n  Listserv mailing lists:\n\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\n  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the\n  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,\n  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass\n  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send\n  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.\n\nMicrostation Imager\n-------------------\n  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS\n  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\n\n  Feature Description\n\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\n\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\n  for GIS applications.\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\n\nPCI\n---\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\n\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\n  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't\n  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your\n  particular application/interest calls for.\n\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\n\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\n  graphic-arts industry's \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\n  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\n  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\n\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\n  areas.\n\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\n--------------------------------\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\n\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\n\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X\n  for display.\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\n\nCLRview\n-------\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\n\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,\n  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.\n\n  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \n  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.\n\n  Contact:\n  Rodney Hoinkes\n  Head of Design Applications\n  Centre for Landscape Research\n  University of Toronto\n  Tel:   (416) 978-7197\n  Email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca\n\n==========================================================================\n\nEnd of Resource Listing",

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\n in the dressing room.\n\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\n\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\n on the 1-3 goal.\n\n Lines information follows further below.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\n Attendance: 3,500\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Group B results:\n\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\n\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\n Attendance: 10,200\n\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\n\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\n Attendance: 2,800\n\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\n whole game). The Finns took the lead on a Jarkko Varvio slap shot from the\n blue line, and a soft goal for an unscreened Mike Richter.\n As far as the play in the second period goes, the Finns seemed to have the\n most control, so a 1-0 lead was warranted as I saw it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t\t   SWEDEN\t\t\t   CANADA\n\n Goaltender:\t30 Tommy Soderstrom\t\t30 Bill Ranford\n\n Defense:\t 8 Kenneth Kennholt\t\t 5 Norm Maciver\n\t\t14 Fredrik Stillman\t\t24 Dave Manson\n\n\t\t 3 Peter Popovic\t\t25 Geoff Smith\n\t\t55 Peter Andersson\t\t19 Brian Benning\n\n\t\t 7 Arto Blomsten\t\t 6 Terry Carkner\n\t\t28 Roger Akerstrom\t\t 3 Garry Galley\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t 4 Derek Mayer\n\n Forwards:\t29 Mikael Renberg\t\t15 Dave Gagner\n\t\t 9 Thomas Rundqvist\t\t27 Adam Graves\n\t\t34 Mikael Andersson\t\t22 Mike Gartner\n\n\t\t19 Markus Naslund\t\t20 Paul Kariya\n\t\t21 Peter Forsberg\t\t88 Eric Lindros\n\t\t18 Jonas Bergqvist\t\t 8 Mark Recchi\n\n\t\t 5 Patrik Juhlin\t\t17 Rod Brind'Amour\n\t\t20 Jan Larsson\t\t\t 9 Shayne Corson\n\t\t 4 Stefan Nilsson\t\t11 Kevin Dineen\n\n\t\t22 Charles Berglund\t\t10 Geoff Sanderson\n\t\t26 Michael Nylander\t\t12 Greg Johnson\n\t\t(34 Andersson/18 Bergqvist)\t14 Brian Savage\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t16 Kelly Buchberger\n",

Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they\nwere powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build the\nleague but whether they developed the game is another question altogether.\nAre we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolution\nor are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the \nsport itself?   \n\n\nI can't disagree with you here.\n\n\n\nWhat have you heard?  The Major was the *definitive* little asshole!  He\noriginated the phrase \"if you can't beat 'em in the alley you can't beat\n'em on the ice.\"  That was his idea of hockey.  Do you think, by chance,\nthat Don Cherry is a classy individual?\n\n\nThe money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on, and\nthat is: \"it is the players that are what make the game great and not the\npeople who put them on the ice\"\n\nExactly true.  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch\nis the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame.  I have\nalways thought that this was nonsense.\n\n\n-- ",

Also, it's not the volume of trades that will \nnecessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates\nfor Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a \ngreat player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly\nto the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by \ninjury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back\nproblems from which he never really recovered).\n\nPut Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the \nleague behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.",

It's really unfortunate that the better goalies\nin the league (McLean, Essensa, Vernon) had unspectacular years.

    "text": "\nWell, since the Oilers didn't win a heck of a lot of games, I'm not sure\nthey deserve and MVP (\"can't win without him\").  However, I'd suggest Kelly\nBuchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for\nthe All-Star game notwithstanding.\n\nAs for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations\nthis year due to his \"breakthrough\" year (for him) last year, so he didn't\nreally raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the\ncallups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the\ndepth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on\nthe team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent\nnumbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league\noblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.\nI think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.\n\nAs for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers\ndumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or\neven Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.\n\n-- \nAndrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com\nHP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253",

I agree that you and I could probably argue\nback and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-\nthat is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better \nthan yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original\npost (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not\nthe coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:\n\n\nI think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here\nwhich transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for \nus to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about\ndoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so\nbuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of\nthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to \nprove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second\nround.  He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\"\nSo it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all\na little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will\nimprove as a result.\n\nI think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\non GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how\ngood of a GM he really is.\n\n\nI may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing\nit with you.\n",

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\n6-3 opening victory.\n\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\n\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.\n\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\nSaddledome popcorn.\n\n\"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I'd be\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\nplayoffs.\"\n\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\n\nWhile insisting he is the Kings' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \nVancouver on Thursday.\n\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\ngreat goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.\"\n\n\"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\nmore from him than he does.\"\n\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\n\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\n\n\"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry \ndoesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm\na perfectionist.\"\n\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \neven though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's \na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \nyou're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain \nto him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I \ndo know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.\"\n\nMelrose's \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. \"Before\nyou know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\n\n------\n\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \nChannel 7 here in LA.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\n \n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in \nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\n \n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\n\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is \na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\n \n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \nthe NHL?\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \nchances.\n \n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\n \n Q: What is the five-hole?\n A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: \n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \nright, and (5) five-hole.\n \n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven \nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\n\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \nlost the game, 6-4.\n\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\n\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as \nassistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in \nSeptember of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\n\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \nColonial Hockey Leagues.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n9. Miscellaneous:\n \n For field hockey discussions, go to the newsgroup rec.sport.hockey.field.\n For skating discussions, go to the newsgroup rec.skate.\n \n Some sites get another hockey group, called clari.sports.hockey. c.s.h \nconsists of the UPI feed for all UPI news articles that are related to \nhockey, including game results, summaries, scores, standings, etc.  Much \nof the information in the NHL team news section comes from this newsgroup.\n \n  The rec.sport.hockey Frequently Asked Questions posting is posted semi-\nmonthly, usually on the 1st and 15th of each month, during the hockey \nseason.  This file was originally created by Tom Wilson, who posted it \nduring the 1991-92 season.  It was taken over by Mitch McGowan for the \n1992-93 season.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n  Please make corrections via e-mail, indicating \"r.s.h FAQ\" as the \nsubject line.

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Starting lines:\n\n \tSWEDEN\t\t\t\t\tFINLAND\n\n  35.

    "text": "\n\n       This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada's\nviolent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Our\nnon-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  It\nwould seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun\ncontrol laws.\n\n       I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and\nenforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then\nthat reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.\n\n\n       Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished\nbecause somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a\ncrime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the\nquestion of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising\ngun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to \"magically\"\nkeep the guns out, but now isn't.)\n\n\n       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far \"illegal drugs\"\nare purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. \nI've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals\nhave shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources\n(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply\nsee South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as\nwell, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.\n\n\n        And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques\nof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come\nto mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost\nentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed\nfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you\ncompared the white majority they were virutally identical.\n\n        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.\nnon-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative\nconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of\nnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into\naccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in the\nsame conditions.\n\n        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,\nthen we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are\narguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far\nhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only\nnot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly\nlower.\n\n\n\n       The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. \"inner-city\"\nproblems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition\nwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent\ncrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control\nis the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one\nCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control\nin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase\nin violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently\nthey didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in\nthe early eighties.\n\n\n       True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where\ngun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that\ncrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.\n\n       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high\nor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact\nviolent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it\nwas going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by\nsaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted\nto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you\ncan't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of\nthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control\nwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.\n\n\n       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent\nof gun control.\n\n\n       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what\nothers did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would\nsell to them?",

Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\nwhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he\ndefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\nplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\n\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\nAtlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\n\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\nalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\n\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\nlike eminent domain...)\n\nLet me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\n\n    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\n    extortion statutes.\")\n\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party's act of demanding the right\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\nthey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\n\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\nplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\n\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\nshouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\nAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\n\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone's property rights were protected; the\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\n(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n\n\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\nschool.\n\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\n\nI called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons\nI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\n\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\nother people's property by eminent domain.)\n\n\nReally?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say\nabout cases like _Boomer_?\n\n\nI've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\nas \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\nanalysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\nthe scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by\n_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics\nof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.",

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio\nBooks, Inc.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,\nDC  20006.\n\n   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,\n1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\n\n  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\nAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute\nbetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far\nmore than that.\n\n   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\ngiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\nfierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\nAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\nhostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\nall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\nSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\n\n   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\nthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\n\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\nmatter how risky they may be.\n\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\nmy friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.\n\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\n\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\n\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\nreign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\n\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\n\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\nNavy.\n\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\n\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\n\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\nthem.\n\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\n\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\n\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\nmajor media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\n\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\n\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\nnot Britain.\n\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\nIsland at all?\n\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\nenormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\nI will describe shortly.\n\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\nWashington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\nand verify them.\n\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\n\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\nthe \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\nthe world.\n\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\nand Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\n\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\nBrothers.\n\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\n\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\nHemisphere war.\n\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\nbut very little of the air changes places.\n\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\nHemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\nnatural resources.\n\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\nNo. 36.\n\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\nRockefellers.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\ninherit the Earth.\n\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\n\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\n\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme\nimportance in the coming war.\n\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\ndown virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\n\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\nPacific.\n\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\n\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. \nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\nappearance both during and after construction.\n\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\n\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara\npresided over the public paring back of America's visible\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\n\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\ntechniques.\n\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\npowered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\n\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\n\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" has\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\n\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\ngenerates the field.\n\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\nStates Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\n\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\nbeing called the \"Falklands crisis.\"\n\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\n\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\nWAR ONE.\n\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\nWashington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\nwith Russia.\n\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\n\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\nfast running out.\n\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\ncertain ways.\n\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\nand is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" now\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\n\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\n\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\n\n   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known to\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\nare known to be as I described last month.\n\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\n\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\n\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\n\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\nalso its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\n\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\ndo.\n\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\n\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\nthe Argentine flag.\n\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\n\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\n\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\nwould be a nerve gas.\n\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\ncontrolled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\n\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\ndoors would be suicide.\n\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\npreparations.\n\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"Red\nAlert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\nsea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\n\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\ncertain officials.  He got them!\n\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\nofficial stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada were\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\n\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\nshambles of the plan.\n\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\nknown, there were no survivors.\n\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\nresults, both important:\n\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\n\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\nNew Zealand!\n\n   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" \nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\n\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\nstill out of range.\n\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\n\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\ntactics which the Russians employed.\n\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\naround the world.\n\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\n\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\n\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze\nmovement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\nthere were a nuclear war.\n\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\nmoney--and plenty of it.\n\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\nmachine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\n\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\nand Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\nRockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity\nright now for the Rockefellers.\n\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\n\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. \nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\n\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\nname, though this may be changed, is the \"World Nonproliferation\nCouncil.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\n\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\n\n   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea\nmay well be at hand.\n\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture\ntells us, our Lord \"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but\nof power, of love, and of a sound mind.\"  We must learn to wage\npeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \"Blessed are the\npeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\"",

    "text": "From: New Liberation News Service <nlns>\nSubject: NLNS: Fascism with a Friendly Face\n\n/* Written  8:33 pm  Apr 14, 1993 by nlns@igc.apc.org in igc:nlns.news */\n/* ---------- \"NLNS Packet 3.11 *** 4-14-93\" ---------- */\n\nFascism with a Friendly Face: Does Rush Limbaugh Remind You of \nAnyone?\nDaevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge\n\n\"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that \nHitler was original and showed initiative.\" \n--Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network, \nOctober 27, 1992.\n\n(NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of \nMein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to \nBe before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was \nindependent and sharp as a scalpel.\n\tMy effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At \nleast it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the \nidea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for \ndelivery.\n\tThose reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the \nmost peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are \nnoted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \npassion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \nfact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \nidentical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \nelection). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \nenthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \nideological quilt.\n\tThe last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \npages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the \nGerman nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \nline between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \nwas \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when \nthere has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\n\tIn fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \nthe Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \nsucceeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \nclaim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement \nceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of \ncourse, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \nGod against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \ntoo gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\n\tOf course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, \nmy main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern \nAmerican Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version \nof Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), \nand trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen \nmillion followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book \nafter building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in \nWeimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.\n\tThus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily \nthree-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary \npropoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way \nThings Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a \ntranslation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the \nprinted word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since \nradio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of \nluxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to \nspend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop \n$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.\n\tBut, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \ncloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \ntheir propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \ndays.)\n\tMort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf \nHess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \nABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio \nprogram's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \nshow, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \nknows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \nthat Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \nopportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \nearns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a \nRICO indictment.\n\tOn questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \nmaterial in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For \nexample:\n\nOn Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\n\tHitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \nindividually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \nperhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in \norder to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \nimagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \nfor their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \nthought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \n(page 577).\n\tLimbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The \nshow is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \nbrain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \naptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \nwith me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media \nwill slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \nand screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\n\nOn Religion as the Basis of a Nation\n\tHitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \ninseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \ndecline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \nculture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \nsins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \nexpulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \nBut our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \nambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \ncharming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \nfor the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \nAmerican education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\n\nOn Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\n\tHitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \nOne has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \ntheatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \nTheatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \nmust be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \nservice of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \nHollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \nwho believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \nand monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\n\nOn the News Meida\n\tHitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \ngravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \nby in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the \npeople's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \nslavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the \nbandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \nreplaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \nthe Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \nnetwork. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't \nrealize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \ntherefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \nand, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)\n\n*     *     *\n\t\nTo continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \nultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\n\tAfter putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \nhaunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \nGermans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \nGermans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \nRush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \ndepressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \nradical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \nReagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \nThe Fascist States of America.\n\tAnd if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \nradical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only \nwonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.\n\nThe Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-\n0845; (608) 255-4460.",

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\n\t     \n\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \nsystem.\n\t     \n\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\n\t     \n\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \nalso.\n\t     \n\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\n\t     \n\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \nat this time.  It's great to have you.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\n\t     \n\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \nfrom school to the work place.\n\t     \n\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \nmake things happen.\n\t     \n\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \nthe rest of you.\n\t     \n\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \n\t     \n\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \nwith changing times.\n\t     \n\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \nlong run.\n\t     \n\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \nlearn.\n\t     \n\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \ncan be learning and working at the same time.\n\t     \n\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \ncan prepare students for this world of work.\n\t     \n\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \nareas of the country.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \nwords is that so important?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \ntaught before.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \n\t     \n\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \neducational component of training.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \nyoung people even beyond the summer.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \ndeveloping.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \nget in a high school diploma.  \n\t     \n\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \nemployers.\n\t     \n\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \nthe earnings of American workers.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \nalready out there.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\n\t     \n\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\n\t     \n\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \nstrategy.\n\t     \n\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \nskills for on-the-job learning.\n\t     \n\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \nalready being done.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\n\t     \n\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \ncoming forth before too long.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \n\t     \n\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \nlife-long learning in this country.\n\t     \n\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \nthat we need to meet.\n\t     \n\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \nI wonder if you would comment on that.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \nfor jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \nTodd of Austin, Texas.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \nvery supportive.  \n\t     \n\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \n\t     \n\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \n\t     \n\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \nworking on that.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \ntrained on a year-round basis.\n\t     \n\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \nmoving.\n\t     \n\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \n\t     \n\t     Doctor?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \nextremely effective learning strategy.\n\t     \n\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \n\t     \n\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \nthem and we can discuss it later.\n\t     \n\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\n\t     \n\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \nvocational program.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \nstudents that needs them.\n\t     \n\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \ncareer directions.\n\t     \n\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  ",

    "text": "\n\nYour comment here is meant as a put down. It fails for several reasons :\n\n1) You have edited out the context of the action under discussion. \n2) I never brought the legal definition up. I use the English language\nand not the legal dialect. The legal definition of fraud changes from\none country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality\nof censorship.\n\n\n\n\nYou are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance\nin which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case.\nIf you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you\nthought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using\nwas a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of\ncircumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they\ndo not apply, thus the action is not permisable.\n\nObviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it\nwould be contrary to the internet comercial use.\n\n\nNow you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was\nthe fact of association between the company and the post that was important.\nThe typeface etc is inconsequential.\n\n\n\nIf you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick\nStaffords posts into soc.culture.british. If you are suggesting that \nadvocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it\ndirectly. \n\nCertainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to\ncall for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part\nof what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.\n\n\n\nThat is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility\ncost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe\nto USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is\nquite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and\nregulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example\nif a Microsoft employee were to post \"Windows NT is crap don't buy it\"\nfrom a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to\nsack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has \npolitical objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political\nmanner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political\nplatform for his views.\n\n\n\nah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.\n\n\n\nYour article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature\nand pretty well damn all else. \n\n\n\nAre you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments\non the substantive case?\n\nThe initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable\njudgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be\nharmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the\nsubstance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets\nact could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already.\nThe part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.\n\nHere again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that\ninformation is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated\nto third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this\ncase as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves. \n\nThe crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law.\nThe censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's\nludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book. \n\n\n\nFunny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in\nrejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion\nis unprovable I left it at that. \n\nSo far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your\nown. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the\nvalidity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions. \nPlus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this\nproblem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret\nsession and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the\nissues are half as simple as you imply.\n\n\nI don't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that\nof proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat.\n",

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike \nWhitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh \nInternational Airport and with me is the President of the United \nStates Bill Clinton.\n\t     \n\t     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk \nabout in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just \nbreaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been \nkind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in \nthe trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard \nthat two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and \nOfficer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been \nfound not guilty.\n\t     \n\t     It's a situation that's been building for over a \nyear since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  \nAnd I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see \nthe situation in Los Angeles in connection with your \nadministration and what you're trying to do.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the \nAmerican people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a \ntribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the \nefforts of the federal government in developing the case.\n\t     \n\t     The law under which the officers were tried is a \ncomplex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury \ndecided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible \nfor supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did \nmost of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked \nRodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some \nblows, and another officer who was a rookie.\n\t     \n\t     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but \nit appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They \nacknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think \nthat the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But \nI hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  \nfirst of all, the importance of trying to bring this country \ntogether and not violate the civil rights of any American; \nsecondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  \n\t     \n\t     I think it's important to recognize that in the \npoorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this \ncountry, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're \neven more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our \nefforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police \nofficers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a \nwaiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some \nother things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to \nviolence and drugs.\n\t     \n\t     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to \nme that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic \nrevitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed \nareas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles \nwho wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many \nproblems as we do.  \n\t     \n\t     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the \ncampaign to try to bring private investment and public investment \nto bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, \nRon Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies \nfor that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest \nunemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the \ncountry.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to \nthe new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several \nother people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with \nregard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let's talk about what brings you to the \nPittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a \nlot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  \nYou've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you \nsaid earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break \nthat gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to \nAllegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that \nbattle?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \nof all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \nme in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \neconomic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \ngives the country a very different budget for the next five years \nthan we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \nat the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \nhealth care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\n\t     \n\t     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \nshort run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money \nto create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \nto try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \nto try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \nplan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \nSenate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \nbloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come \nto a vote.\n\t     \n\t     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote \nfor the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican \nleader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to \nstay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases \nthe deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending \ntargets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for \nthis year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \nyears.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the \neconomy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that \nare holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for \nbillions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --\nmuch of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.\n\t     \n\t     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  \nI've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \nthink that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \nright now to show that we're changing the direction of the \ncountry.  And that's the purpose of the bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or \nhis office lately?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk \nregularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison \noperation to the senators that we think are open to this --\nSenator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \nfrom Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \nothers whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and \nknow that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life \nof the budget I presented.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \ngot a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \nis that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \nof the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \nhave this program well below the spending targets that Congress \nhas already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \nyears, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \nvoting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as \nputting the American people back to work.  \n\t     \n\t     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political \nissue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and \nthe need for jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I have some questions from people who supported \nyou, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  \nIt has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot \nof people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \nthink some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the \nWhite House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go \nthrough.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And \nthey're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull \nit off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew \nit was going to be like this.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask \npeople, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving \nvery fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the \nfastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in \nhistory, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we \nare moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on \npolitical reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole \nwide range of things.  \n\t     \n\t     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn \nit around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions \nwhich led to the victory I received from the people in November, \nand we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making \nreal, real progress.  \n\t     \n\t     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  \nWe're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going \nto happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing \nthings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Thank you very much.  \n\t     \n\t     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \nhere live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, \nKDKA News.",

The trap is the easy way out.\n\tFor yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the\ndemographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,\nand much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're\ngoing to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic\ngroup or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors\nleading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than\nnot, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.\n\tIf, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few\nBlacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime\nstatistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then\nworry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable\nor whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to\ndefine \"us\" and \"other\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous\nwhen we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational\nhumans.\n\tIt's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the\n*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial\nmakeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in\nSan Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \"ethnic diversity\". Here, we\nhave Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \"model minority\") gangs,\nand even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly\ntroublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their\npropensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on\nthe street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and\ncrime are what they most fear. During the \"disturbance\" in Los Angeles last\nyear many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I\nremember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs\nwhere there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned\nfrom TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives\nthat live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly\nmulti-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that\nin the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*\nriot!\n\tIn closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points\nthat really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the\nracism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As\na people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem\nbecomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly\nbelieve that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current\ncourse of denial and repression.\n\tI wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,\nluck in avoiding the \"trap\". \n\tPeace, my brother.\n\t\t\tm.\n-- \n\n\n",

PST\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \non the aid package.\n\n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \n\n\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \ntomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \nfront of you.\n\t     \n\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \n\t     \n\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \na vastly expanded relationship.\n\t     \n\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\n\t     \n\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \nthereafter for the life of the deal.\n\t     \n\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \n\t     \n\t     The President has also decided to create a \nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\n\t     \n\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \nlaunching.  \n\t     \n\t     The President is also calling for the development of \na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \nRussia.\n\t     \n\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \n\t     \n\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \nenvironmental damage.\n\t     \n\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \nproblem full-time.  \n\t     \n\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \nimportant.\n\t     \n\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \n\t     \n\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \nconference, the G-7 conference.\n\t     \n\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \nobjectives with you.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \nconstruction of that storage facility.  \n\t     \n\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \nlast couple of years.  \n\t     \n\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \n\t     \n\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \nas a very important step in that process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \ntoday.  So it's completely new.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \nRussia needs.\n\t     \n\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \nthat are already there?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On that point, should other American companies \nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \nbillion?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \ncurrent year budget costs --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \nwhich the payments are due?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \ngoing to be involved in that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\n\t     \n\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \nour own government, but the resources of the American private \nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \ninto that situation?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \ncould promote American grain sales.  \n\t     \n\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \nfor a concessional loan program.  \n\t     \n\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \nand it's important for the American farm community.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \nis that right? \n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \nthe short-term payments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \nable to do so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \nhave a range from 0 to --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \nsame level of food imports from the West.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \nsome of the other republics?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \n\t     \n\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \nsector can do that.  \n\t     \n\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \n\t     \n\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \nsignal to the American business community that we support their \nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \nsupport them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \ndeliver on making Russia a more --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \nthe work.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \nRussian government for distribution at their will?\n\t     \t    \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \nthese programs.\n\t     \n\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \nnoticed.\n\t     \n\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \nPresident has to do on that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \nyou got here?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \nwe take any action.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \nit stands now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \nthat it was not previously set to be?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \nfunds might be expended.\n\t     \n\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \nfurther our programs.\n\t     \n\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \nfound it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \nFreedom Support Act funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In other words, all of the money is being \ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \nlegislative history of those funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     cooperation --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \nhappened here --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \n\t     \n\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\n\t     \n\t     Q?\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \nearmarked and put it into this fund?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \n\t     \n\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \nAnd we'll do it.  \n\t     \n\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     taken it way from any --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \nbut we thought we should now.\n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \n\t     \n\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \nis another Clinton initiative.  \n\t     \n\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \n\t     \n\t     I would also say that the President has given \nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \nobjective.  \n\t     \n\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \nassistance package for Russia.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \nRussian government?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \nsource.\n\t     \n\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \nexample of that.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \nthem together and to focus their efforts.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \nup in the next couple of days on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \ntogether for about two weeks.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \nIs that in the out years?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \nthe state industries is important to them.  \n\t     \n\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \n\t     \n\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \nallied governments that are also active.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \nyou came in with?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \nwhich is our base objective here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \nprivatization?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     money for job training for workers whose \njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \nallocated any money for that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \nsingle --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \nsingle, individual dwellings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \nserved by this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \ndone.  \n\t     \n\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \nspend the money wisely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is it about this program that convinces \nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \nespecially considering their other debt problem?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President say that the value of the \nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \nprogram that does this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \nyears from now?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \nfrom now to pay back those loans.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     substantial government-to-government loan \nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     government loans in any other sector that \nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \nto say this is a new and unique effort.",

    "text": "{Sorry, Harel et al, but our doctors and most hospitals are still\nprivate in Canada as well as in much of Western Europe.}\n\n\nWrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health\ninsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like\nsocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary\ninsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\nyou're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\nfor the U.S.\n\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\"\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\njust a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\ncounterparts on issues like these).\n\nI'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know\nit, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\nshouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\nspend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a\ndifferent culture.\n\n\n\"Managed Care\" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western\nnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France\nand Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says\nof HMO/NHS approaches, \"We left that behind with East Germany!\").\nSure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling\ndoctors with budget strings.\n\nIn Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France\nand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public\nhospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\n\"sickness funds\" over a century old while Canada divides by their\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\n\nWith such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The\nFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations\nin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.\n\ngld",

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\n\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\n\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\n\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\ndon't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\n\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\nachieve a good result.\n\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\n\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\n\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\nthought.\n\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\n\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\n\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\n\n\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\n   and of Judaism.\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\n   the Promised Land.\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\n   of all humans everywhere.\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\n   saved them.\n\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]\n\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\n   memorable line of the evening.\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\n   Epiphanes....\n\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\nstate of Israel.\n\nSomeone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He\nstirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\nbrought about.\n\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\nand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\nnone the less valid).\n\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\nwas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\n\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\nwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\n\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\ninstruments of God's will?\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\nJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\npunishment.\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.",

    "text": "{I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the\nweekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improved\nversion anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}\n\nThe standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents \nis probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, \"Hermeneutrik und \nKritik,\" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of\n_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:\nBeck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The \nProphetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).\n(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley\ndescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little\nknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject\nand the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form\nof \"rules for forgers.\"  It makes interesting reading.\n\nI confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract\nthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and\nas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,\nI believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that \nany competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient\ndocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one \nwould expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not \nbe able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to \ndetermine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and \nculture or is a later forgery.\n\nActually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:\n\n1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example\nthe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific\nmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found\nwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual\nphysical objects.\n\n2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the\ncopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a\ndocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something\nfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several\ngenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still \nbe tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot\nexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so\nwe must confine our testing to the text itself.\n\nIt is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if\nthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the\ndocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard\nof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king\nin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up\nscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the\nholograph).  They could check the language, content and writing\nstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a\nPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were\npositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually\nwrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but\n(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for \ncomparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to\ndetermine who the actual author was.\n\nAs I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the\ntests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  \nSpecifically we might ask:\n\n1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict\nitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to \nmaintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The \nlonger the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.\nFor this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.\n\n2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?\nAgain a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the\nwriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be\nable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous\nthings which someone from that culture would get right without even\nthinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous \nand trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.\n\n3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech\netc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that \nseem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  \nIf so do they fit in with the culture?\n\nOf course there are complications if the document has been\ntranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language\nwhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture\nclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and\nreduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.\n\nThese tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work \nwith) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the \nhistorian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to \nask are, \"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we \nknow about the culture of claimed origin?\"  If there are things \nwhich don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to\nour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really \nsignificant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never\nknow everything about the culture.",

    "text": "Heres the life of St. MAria Goretti, posted with kind permission of\nthe editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine \"Morning Star\".\n\nHope you like it.\n\n    Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti\n\n\n\n    Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,\n    the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\n\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\n    on\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\n\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\n    Eucharist.\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\trest  of  the\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\n    until\n\n\t\t\t\t   -4-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.\n\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\tMaria\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\n    did the Holy Will of God.\n\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\ttwice\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\tlived\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\n\n\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\n    handkerchief,\"  as\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\n    91/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\n    him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\ttouch\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\n    held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.\n\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\t\"No I\n    will  not,\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\n    knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\n    of the baby Teresa\ton  the  landing  brought  the\tattention  to\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\n\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\taway.\n    As\tthe  ambulance\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\n    Communion\n\n\t\t\t\t   -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \"Yes.  For the\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\n    in\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\n    died at about three o'clock.\n\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\n    in\tMaria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the\n    first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.\n\n    May St. Maria Goretti help\tus  to\tbe  pure  and  grant  us  the\n    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.\n\n    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.\n\n\n    by Brendan Arthur\n",

Having experienced God, I try to make sense of\nthat experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things\nthat echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my\nbeliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That\ndoesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe\nI will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my\nbeliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.\n\nIf someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what.\nNeither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out\nof a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different\nexplanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the\nunderlying experiences are similar.\n\nSome people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one\nform, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and\ninflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an\noutsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a\nmystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence\navailable to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can\nbased on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my\nunderstanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than\nmy own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover\nsomething new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.\n\nPeace\nWill Taber\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ",

While it holds PARTICULAR\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.

I've got a problem that \nI need as many people's help from as possible.\n\nBefore I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell\nyou that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy\nmeets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...\n\nOK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family\nand I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the\nstreet, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me...\nher name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have\nbeen writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about\n2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago. \n\nBy the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.\n\nOK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming\nback to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I\ndrove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent\nthe whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though\nwe had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being\nin person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met.\n(She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could\nask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to \nmention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but\nshe had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family\nis one of those families who goes to church but that is about the\nextent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she\nknows I am a Christian. \n\nWell, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such\na thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid\nyou not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.\n\nIn out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding\ndates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her).\nShe has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended\nup leaving school....Now we are at the present...\n\nLet me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....\n\n\n\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not\ngoing to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College\njust wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and\nthat just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested\nme & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was\ninterested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with \nkids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents\ncould tell.\n\n\"So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now\nI have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room\nM-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and \nit's great experience.\n\n\"As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the very\nnear future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to\nstudy. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of\nyears. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be\nto Kansas.\n\n\"Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district \nmanager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for\nabout 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll \nbasically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to \nchose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on either\none of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't it\nbe fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??\nWhat do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.\n\n\"This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay\nand any thye of management experience would look good on an application\nor resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good\nbenefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time\nservice, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng\nfor me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up \npaying out of state tuition wherever I go.\n\n\"Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I \nrespect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for \nsoooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really \ngood. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i want\nto do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something.\nI don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female\nis too bad. \n\n\"Anyway, onto your career decisions. I'll solve your problem right now,\nMARRY ME...\n\n\"You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously\n(or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the\nhome life later.\"\n\n***********\n\nOK, well I'm sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you\nthink she meant about the marraige thing?? \n\nI dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her\nletter!!! I don't know what to think??\n\nSince she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a \nBass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???\n\nI always pick on those people who graduate from high school and\nget married....but what does she mean??? \n\nI've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that \nI don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that\nmost college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the\nGreeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and here\nshe says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!\n\nMaybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am\nso attracted to paying some real attention to me.\n\nI mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'm\nonly 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling through\nclasses..\n\nI have prayed about this over the past year from time to time..\nsaying, \"God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..\"\n\nCould this be my sign???\n\nI would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes \nit worse..\n\nShould I call her?? I'm terrible over the phone. I don't even like\nto talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.\n\nI mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very\naverage guy like me??\n\nI'm really confused....I would really appreciate any help i can get.\n\nThanx \n\nChris",

This is in response to a question about\nthe Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification\nup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]\n\nThere is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the\nmention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \"Annunciation\" by\nAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28\n\n And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto\n a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a\n man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's\n name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\"Hail,\n thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed\n art thou among women.\"_\n\nNow, now, hold that line of thought - \"the Lord is with Mary &\nblessed art thou among women\" - while you read on....\n\nIn the book, \"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of\nDevotion to Mary\" by Peter Lappin:\n\nThe _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated\nthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\nthat the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \"The Conception\nof Saint Anne\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\nis the incorruptible timber \"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\nof Christ's sinless body\"; she is \"God's Eden, in whom there is\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\"  Her perfect\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\nshe was hailed as \"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\".\n...\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\n...\n\nNow let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\nFrom \"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\" by John A. Hardon:\n\nBaptism -\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\n\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\n power to think and to choose freely.\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\n title to enter heaven.\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\nfreely.\n\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\nbodies on the last day...\n\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):\n\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was:\n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\nBlessed art thou amongst women\".\n\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\n\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\n                definitely want to be with those He\n                has made _blessed_)\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\n\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\nand blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body\nof Christ and so,\n\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart.

He supports his claim in several ways.   \nThe Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the  \nWHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese  \nsuccess of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the  \nworld.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible  \nalso talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am  \nparaphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected,  \nthe whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a  \nstate of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the \"do  \nit if it feels good\" mentality all over the world.

Anyway...)\n\n\tThe basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of\nMary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles \nand all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their\nministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were\npresent when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days\nlater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of\nthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was\nstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There\nwas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else\nwas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed\nthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  \npreaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently \nconsidered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind\nby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the\napostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down\nin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the\nauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.

    "text": " \n: [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]\n \n: One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate \n: (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No\n: reasonable alternative exists.\n\nI would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; \ncauses precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be\nan answer to \"how\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \n\"nothing\", science has some good candidates for an answer.\n\nI have always wondered why Christians use the \"There are questions\nscience (or atheism) cannot answer\" argument; I hope this is the\nappropriate group to ask this question.\n\nThe most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the\nuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?\n\nI think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n\n1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n\nand\n\n2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n\nIt is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\nis it a meaningful question, after all?\n\nI would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nA die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt\none's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -\nI cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -\ncan I ever be sure I exist?\n\nHowever, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone\ninsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )\n\nA being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence.\nA being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be\npointless - the being would exist anyway.\n\nLet us return to the original question: why? A being that does not\nexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being\nis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let\nus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity\npostulate). The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\ndemanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\nor in non-existence\". Actually, both questions turn out to be\ndevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\ndon't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nI seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nSome Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\nHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\nanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\nactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\nthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAnother answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\nThis sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\nHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\nit can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\nexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\nThis argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,\nand from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.\nI think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.\n\nThe best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\nof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\naccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nThe second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?\nbelongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the\nquestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have\nsuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge\nfrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent\nHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,\nWorld Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more\nappropriate for discussions like this.\n \n: As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn't\n: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n\nThis is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\nnot why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\nquestions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\nsupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\nas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n \n: I believe the \"genetic code\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,\n: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, \n: reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I\n: can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*\n: technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n: having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n\nThis opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\nsomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\nin general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\nthey have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nThere is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,\nalthough not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution\ncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although\ntheir code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book\n\nSteven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan\nCape, London 1992.\n\nArtificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no \nspark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not\nviolate any physical laws as we know them. \n\n: You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your\n: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you\n: really have nothing to worry about, eh?\n\nExactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical\natheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to \nfind peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would\nnormally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc,\nbut it seems many Christians do not read these groups. \n\nPetri\n",

    "text": "\n \nFirst of all, the original poster misquoted.  The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16.\nThe author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but \"(at best) \nsecond-hand\".\n\n\t\"And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching\n\t Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and\n\t he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, \"Saul, Saul,\n\t why are you persecuting Me?\"  And he said, \"Who art Thou, Lord?\"  And\n\t He said, \"I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . .\"\n\t\t(Acts 9:3-5, NAS)\n\nPaul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!  (Pretty cool, eh?)  He\nbecame closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were \nfollowers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth.\n\n\nI agree.  I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you \nthe Spirit exists.  Please don't complain about this being circular.  I know\nit is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural?\n(This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)\n\n\nThe Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get?\nThe Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as \"inspired by God\", \nliterally means \"God-breathed\".  In other words, God spoke the actual words \ninto the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is \none that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and \nincompleteness of \"inspired by God\".\n\n\nThat's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a \nbook written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks \nof life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.\n\n\n\nWhat source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior\nhistoricity to the Bible?  Certainly not Josephus' writings, or the writings \nof the Gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.\n\n\nJesus was fully God as well.  That's why I'd assert that he is wise.\n\n\nPlease rethink this last paragraph.  If there is no God, which seems to be your\ncurrent belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not\nonly did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards\nto C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus?\n\tIn conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based\non gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims.  \nThe Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out.\n\tAbout your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire the\nwriters, but he guides the reader as well.  We cannot understand it in the \nleast without the Spirit's guidance:\n\n\t\"For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit \n\tsearches all things, even the depths of God.\"  (1 Cor 2:10, NAS)\n \nPeace and may God guide us in wisdom.\n\n+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=\nCarter C.

Vs 6-8 makes it\nplain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but\nthose who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he\nwas an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those\nwho belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises\ngiven to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or\nnothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law? \nCertainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.

To this day some try to \n\texplain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Mary's\n\tprediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.\n\n\tMary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all\n\tover the world and persecute religion.  \n\n\tShe said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.  Every\n\tsingle one has been realized.  \tOne can only use the term \"coincidence\"\n\tso many times in the same explanation before its use becomes \n\tridiculous.  \n\n\tSO...yes, there are many false prophets and many false reports.

    "text": "A few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on\nearth:\n\nOne piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\nthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\nburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\ncross, would want to share in his death.",

He\n     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious\n     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that\n     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual\n     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly\n     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*\n\n          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the\n     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted\n     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise\n     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.\n\n          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-\n     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-\n     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.\n\n          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth\n     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and\n     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which\n     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against\n     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had\n     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and\n     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the\n     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some\n     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the\n     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,\n     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back\n     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and\n     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the\n     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came\n     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them\n     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).\n\n          How did this tomb become empty?\n\n          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--\n     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological\n     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*\n     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by\n     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb\n     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the\n     chimney at Christmas time.\n\n          But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down\n     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa\n     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the\n     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.\n\n          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-\n     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by\n     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.\n\n          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,\n     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar\n     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)\n     that the women went to the wrong tomb.\n\n          The facts are these:\n\n          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to\n     which by mistake they could have gone.\n\n          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or\n     more people to forget the place where they have buried their\n     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women\n     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to\n     the wrong tomb?\n\n          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?\n\n          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the\n     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.\n\n                  Now when they were going, behold, some\n               of the watch came into the city and showed\n               unto the chief priests all the things that\n               were done.  And when they were assembled\n               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they\n               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,\n               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole\n               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to\n               the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and\n               secure you.  So they took the money, and did\n               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-\n               monly reported among the Jews until this day\n               (Matthew 28:11-15).\n\n          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the\n     fact that the tomb was empty.\n\n          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never\n     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to\n     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.\n\n          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that\n     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples\n     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*\n\n          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?\n     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.\n\n          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject\n     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the\n     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away\n     the body of Jesus.\n\n          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in\n     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to\n     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His\n     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there\n     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,\n     then proved.\n\n          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would\n     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.\n     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most\n     of these men did.\n\n          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ\n     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it\n     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed\n     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing\n     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today\n     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.\n\n          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to\n     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to\n     what had happened to Him.\n\n          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.\n\n          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning\n     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-\n     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He\n     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that\n     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper\n     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).\n\n          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at\n     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren\n     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the\n     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-\n     8).\n\n          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-\n     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed\n     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are\n     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the\n     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the\n     appearances.\n\n          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our\n     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are\n     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest\n     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.\n     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;\n     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of\n     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president\n     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.\n\n          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has\n     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:\n     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.\n\n          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He\n     claimed to have come down *from* God.\n\n          He said He was the way *to* God.\n\n          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.\n\n          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one\n     else had it.\n\n          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to\n     us.\n\n          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed\n     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*\n\n          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe\n     that His words are all true?\n\n          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us\n     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?\n\n          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead\n     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some\n     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.\n\n          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all\n     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For\n     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-\n     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a\n     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.",

Watson) asks:\n > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?\n \n       The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. \nEaster (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan\nwhore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is \"what is\nthe objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?\"  When phrased\nthat way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately\napparent what my objection to \"celebrating\" her would be.\n \n > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.\n \n      No, you are thinking perhaps of \"Ressurection Sunday\" I think. \n(Though I'm not too crazy about the word \"Sunday\", but I certainly like\nthis phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)\n     For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of\nFirst Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following\nthe Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern\nparlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection\non the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all\nover the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday\nfollowing Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical\nmethods?\n \n > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate\n > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that\n > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?\n \n      So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore\ngoddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that\nwhore out of the discussion.\n \n > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if\n > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of\n > words we are going to have to drop.

And while we are at it, the left-handed people are\nboth \"sinister\" and \"gauche\" so we probably will have some objections from\nthat quarter as well.\n \n > In Quebec French, the word for the celebration of the\n > resurrection is \"Pa^ques\"--this is etymologically related\n > to Pesach (Passover) and the pascal lamb.  So is the\n > French Canadian (mostly Roman Catholic) celebration better\n > because it uses the right name?\n \n      Yes, that sounds much better to me.

What happened to \"there is\n > neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for\n > all are one in Christ Jesus\"?\n \n      Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon's \"slave\"\nreturned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon\nPhilemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different \"rules\" that\napply to them as well?  Or if there is no more \"male and female\" can Adam\nand Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are\ndifferences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in\nMessiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.\n \n---------------------------------------\n\n[I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it\nseems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is\nnew -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.\n\nI'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this\nargument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of\nthe week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some\nChristians prefer to refer to \"first day\", \"second day\", etc.  However\nthe majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question\nseems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows\nas the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when\nthey use it is different.\n\nIndeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be\ndangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the\ncelebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convince\nthem that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run\nthe risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.\nThey are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds\nbetween their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear that\nthis is a healthy thing.",

    "text": "\n\nI beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models.\nScientific models are a game to play, and are only as good as the\nassumptions and measurements (if any) that go into them.\n\nAs an example, I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in\natmospheric science.  It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that\none of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of\nthe nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume\nthat the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one-\ndimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds\nblow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\n\nTo quote from H.S. Yoder,\n\n\tThe postulated models have become accepted as the reality\n\tinstead of the lattice of assumptions they are.\n\tAuthoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical\n\tanalysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticism\n\tof the model approach to earth problems is warranted because\n\tmany key parameters have not been included.\n\nThis statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.  Only when\nconvincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results\nmay one suggest that the model may describe the reality.  Just thought\nI'd clear that up before things really got out of hand. \n \n-- \nboundary",

    "text": "\nBetween Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man\noccurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual\nworld.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through\nhistory.  The Greek, for example, could say, \"better a beggar in the land\nof the living than a king in the land of the dead.\" (Iliad, I think).\n\nThe question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\nan ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam\nor Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their\nsins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile\nhumanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to\nhim.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom\nSatan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.\n\n\nIt is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The\nrelationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely\nextended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine\nan eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the\nspiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.\n\nIt was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous\nwere lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness\nthat fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with\nthe sense world.\n\nIt would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient\npeople's ideas of life after death.\n\n\nMankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \"the turning point of\ntime\" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and\nwe are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new\nrevelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new\nvision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains\nsomething new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and\nmuch more as well.\n\n(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf\nSteiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my\nviews on this subject).\n\n\nThe way you refer to it as \"doctrine\" puts a modern intellectual coloring\non it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually\nconcrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or\nteachings today can be received.\n\nI am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to\nsimple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed\non, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception\nand experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of\nexpression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately\nafter death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In\nany case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,\nbut by contemplating the principles themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity\nthat originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the\nhuman being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is\ncreated at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas\ndominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does\ntoday. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same\ntime lived during that darkened time when the perception of our\neternal spiritual being had grown dim.\n\n\nIndeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal\nirrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in\nwhich we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a\nsingle earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the\nreality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in\nterms that did not try to spell it out.\n",

God may choose one individual over\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\n\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\n\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\nrefute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\nChrist's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\n\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\nthe Baptist,\n\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\n\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing's \"The\nEducation of the Human Race\".\n\nTo return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob and\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\nChrist, in my view.",

The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\nsimply IS holy.\n\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\nmass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.\n\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\npriest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\nIt doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only\nslightly better.\n\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\ndoesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\n\nIn NYC I can recommend:\n\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St.\n\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \n\tSt. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \"clean\", largely gay\n\tOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\n\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\n\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen",

The argument against the Sabbath is\nthat it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the\nceremonial law is not binding on Christians.

The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are\nright, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.\n\nAccepting the principle of \"sola scriptura\" does not commit us to\nobeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite\nclear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is\non where the Bible would have us place the line.\n\nBy the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters\nthat are not dictated by God.

To come up\nto speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by\npersonality type summary file.\n\nOne observation is that people have significantly different personalities\n(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect\nto church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while\nother people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more\nsolitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if\nconfronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of\npeople.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.\n\nMy impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and\ncreate environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted\n(there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am\nquite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches\nto participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very\nuncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly\ninfluenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.\n(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both\npreferences have their place in the Body).\n\nMaybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words\nare usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert\nscale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is\nexcerpted from my summary:\n\n1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:\n\n        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside\n                          world of people, activities or things.\n\n        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal\n                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.\n\n\nHopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can\nstructure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise\nthe Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities\nto fit them into a particular framework.

It has\n\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\n\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\n\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\n\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\n\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\n\tis the case).\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\n\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\n\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\n\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\n\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\n\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\n\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\n\n\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\n\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\n\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\n\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\n\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\n\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\n\n\tHeaven is one of two final states that\n\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\n\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\n\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\n\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\n\n\n\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\n\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\n\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\n\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\n\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\n\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\n\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\n\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\n\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\n\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\n\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\n\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\n\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\n\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\n\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\n\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\n\tconversion).\n\n\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\n\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\n\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\n\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\n\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\n\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\n\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\n\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\n\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\n\n\n\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\n\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\n\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\n\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\n\ta more expansive view.\n\n\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\n\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\n\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\n\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\n\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\n\n\n\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\n\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\n\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\n\twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\n\tknit relationship with this appelation.\n\n\n\tThere are \"Jesus freaks\" who let the emotional aspects of worship\n\tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\n\tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\n\tthings flow.\n\n\n\tGuilty by association?  That \"christianity\" which forces itself\n\tupon another is not Christianity at all.\n\n\n\tYou appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened\n\t2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?\n\n\tI cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole\n\tresult of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years\n\tgone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert\n\tthat nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.\n\n\n\tChristianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.\n\tWhat do you know of Him?\n",

    "text": "for SRC\n\nIn most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is\nknown as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word\nwhich comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning \"Passover.\" In English,\nGerman, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER,\nor some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the\norigin of this term.\n\nOne explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE\nRATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an\nAnglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\nnot make it more so.\n\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"Spring\nFestival.\"\n\nHowever, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\nKnoblech, in \"Die Sprach,\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\n\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\nof the Resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week),\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\nreferred to simply as \"albae.\" Translaters rendering this into\nGerman mistook it for the plural of \"alba,\" meaning \"dawn.\" They\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\n\"dawn.\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n",

    "text": "\n\nI will answer this as I find time.\n\n\nNotice what I said about this book.  I called it \"Easy reading.\"  The reason I\ndropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical\nSimon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in\nphilosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your\naverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. \nSchaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was\nwritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was\nto simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with\nthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular\nas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) \nHis answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and\ncaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at\ndifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,\nsimplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our\nhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most\npeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to\nsay about this secular scientist at another time.\n\nAlso, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*\ninquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt\nbase.  \n\nLook, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must\nadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in\nkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know\nits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust\nit of all value!\n\nTHis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.\n It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian\nfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we\nfly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic\nlesson of life: \n\n\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\"  \n\nOr as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o\nfreedom.\n\nLet's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to\nabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the\ndifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with\nrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very\nlittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust\ngo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called\nto go on by itself without his understanding.\n\nThis is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the\nChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment\nand say, \"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\"  Now don't read all\nyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand\nyou at all, but I trust you anyway.\" It means that \"I do not understand You *in\nthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\"  Therefore I can\ntrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery\nunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is\na statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of\nFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is\nnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know\nwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all\nthe difference.\n\nNow, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted\ncompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit\nmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith\nlike the insistent \"whying\" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like\nto know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot\nknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other\nleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in\ncoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after\ncoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need\nto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp\nthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may\ncount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  \n\nIf, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust\nhim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian\nleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which\nallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be\nambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to\nus, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.\nAnd that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in\npractice.   ",

In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\nbelow)\n\n\t\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.

The Spirit, then, is\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\n\nand\n\n\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\nthrough the Son\"\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\n\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\na more preeminent way.\n\n\t\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\n\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\n\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\nmention of the Son being necessary.\n\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\nposition, which I enunciated above.\n\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\n\n\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\nfrom it.\"\n\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\n\n\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\nis none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.'\"\n\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\n\n\t\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\nFather,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will\nreceive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\n\t\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\nis the Spirit created.\"\n\t-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\n\n\t\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\nit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,\nit is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to\nspeak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the\nSon, His Sources.\"\n\t-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)\n\n\tThus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,\nPalastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,\nall have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine\nexpressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church\nthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus\nwho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is\nnot enough to bring up the \"proceeds from the Father\" line of the Creed\nor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does\nnot say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does\nproceed from the Father.",

    "text": "Someone sent me this FAQ by E-mail and I post my response here.\n\n[I'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most\nof our readers probably haven't seen it.  --clh]\n\nChrist warns that anyone who \"breaks one of the least of these\ncommandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in\nthe kingdom of heaven\" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I\nmust respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the\npartisan theology.\n\n\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\n\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\n\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\n\n4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ's, then are ye\nAbraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\nAbraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\n\n\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\n\n\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\n\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\nday of the moral law.\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\nmake false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\n\nDarius\n\n[It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\nthink Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\n\nHowever I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\n\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \n\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius'\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it,\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \n\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\nworship was.",
